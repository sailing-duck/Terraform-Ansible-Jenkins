This is a learning project where I learned how to deploy Grafana and Prometheus to EC2 instances using popular DevOps tools such as Terraform, Ansible, and Jenkins.

The project was implemented on AWS Cloud9, which required fewer authentication configurations compared to other environments.

The course, titled "DevOps in the Cloud with Terraform, Ansible, and Jenkins," is available on Udemy. You can find the author's GitHub page at https://github.com/morethancertified/devops-in-the-cloud.

Please note that some codes and configurations may differ from the course materials, as the course was last updated in March 2022.
